# EY Academy

EY Academy is the internal EY training system. It includes the training of employees, the evaluation of their end-of-training presentation, and their evaluation as a trainee. It also includes the evaluation of the trainer by the trainees.
This produces a huge amount of paperwork.
The EY Academy mobile app found here is one of the steps undertaken by EY to ensure the digitalization process that can benefit any company.
This is the Mobile Front End to this application. The backend files can be found in [a separate repository](https://github.com/FarahKa/ey-academy-backend).
